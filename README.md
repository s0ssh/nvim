## nvim

**My simple, optimized Neovim config. This config is a perpetual work-in-progress, and the result of years of daily use predating its public release or even Git tracking entirely.**

### philosophy
- Interaction with codebases from 100 lines to 100,000,000 should be as fluid and organic as possible.
- Movements and macros should be intuitive and aid my workflow, not overwhelm me with options and memorization.
- Use of plugins and dependencies should be minimal, as Neovim is already a very featured piece of software.
- It's a tool, not a lifestyle. Elitism should not undermine the goal of efficiency and elegance.

### notes
- I am a security researcher, not a software engineer; some nice-to-haves may be missing here for SWE workflows. I like to keep my editor simple so I can focus on code review, with development as a secondary priority.
- The philosophy of my config is not intended to influence or replace yours, nor does it intend to demean other schools of thought. Again, it's a tool, not a lifestyle.
